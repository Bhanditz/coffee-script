# How to Keep IcedCoffeeScript Up-to-Date with Mainline CoffeeScript

## Source

### Current Method: Full-blown Rebase

Here is the current system:

1. Add a remote upstream repo to pull in the mainline changes:
```sh
git remote add upstream git@github.com:jashkenas/coffee-script
```

1. Pull from the upstream into our master branch:
```sh
git pull upstream master
```

1. Make sure the local `iced` branch is up-to-date:
```sh
git checkout iced
git pull origin iced
```

1. Then do the rebase (which will fail all sorts of ways, see below...):
```sh
git rebase master
```

1. Then, once the rebase has succeeded:
     a. Update the version number of `package.json`
     a. Update the version number in `src/coffee-script.coffee`

1. Then build a million different times:
```sh
./bin/cake build
./bin/cake build:parser
./bin/cake build
./bin/cake build
./bin/cake build:browser
./bin/cake test
```

1. You're good to push if it all looks good.
     a. First commit all the new changes post-rebase with:
```sh
git commit -a
```
     a. Then do a push to the *<b>iced</b>* branch.
```sh
git push origin iced
```

1. Make and push a new tag (supplying whatever your new version is):
```
git tag -a -m vbump 1.4.0a
git push --tags
```

1. Finally, publish to npm:
```sh
npm publish
```


#### Rebasing will fail!

And when it does, here's what to do: use "theirs."  In practice, I write a
little shell script called `theirs`:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

git checkout --theirs $*
git add $* 
```

And run this on any *autogenerated* file that has a
conflict.  For instance, those files in `lib/coffee-script/` 
or `documentation/js`.  For conflicts in `package.json`, `Cakefile`
or `src/`, you probably need to do a hand-merge.

After addressing the conflict, run `git rebase --continue`
to continue with the rebase.

### Proposed Method A: Compressed Rebase

### Proposed Method B: Merging
